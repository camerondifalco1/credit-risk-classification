# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

Overview
The objective of this analysis is to develop a machine learning model that evaluates loan risk. Leveraging key variables such as loan size, interest rate, borrower's income, and current debt-to-income ratio, we utilised a Logistic Regression model. Accuracy metrics were obtained using a confusion matrix to assess the model's efficacy.

Metrics
Accuracy: The model is 100% accurate in identifying healthy loans.
Precision: The precision score for high-risk loans stands at 87%.
Recall: Not provided in the initial analysis, but a crucial metric for understanding the model's performance in capturing high-risk loans.
Summary and Recommendation
Upon initial evaluation, the model performs exceptionally well in predicting healthy loans but has room for improvement in identifying high-risk loans. In an ideal situation, the performance would be inversed, with greater precision for high-risk loans being more valuable to the bank.

However, dismissing the model outright may be premature. The 87% precision in identifying high-risk loans could potentially represent an improvement over the bank's current risk assessment methods. Therefore, while the model is not perfect, it may offer advantages over existing procedures.

To make a comprehensive recommendation, deeper domain knowledge is required to gauge whether the 87% precision is an acceptable trade-off for the bank.
